# Udacity's Android Development Nanodegree #

----------

## Completing the Android Basics lessons ##

To get motivated to get started again I plan on covering the Android Basic lessons of:

1. User Interface
2. User Input

## The Start ##
I think it is best if you have a rudimentary knowledge of building Android Apps since they do not cover the material covered in the Udacity **Android Basics** course but assume you know it before you start this Nanodegree.

The four courses that were part of the Android Basics are no longer free. I started this Nanodegree in 12/2019 and at that time they were.  

Another complaint I had was that all the material was dated - very dated. Some of the google libraries were no longer supported and discontinued. The material goes all the back to 2014!  

Android development has changed quite a bit since the course material was first developed. In fact, the preferred libraries have changed several times over. This fact, makes it quite difficult to update the material. In addition, the Gradle keywords have changed since the course material was created.

## Does the course prepare you for Android Associate Certification? ##

No. The course is too dated. It does not cover new widgets like `Snackbar`. I am sure there are more areas on the exam not addressed by the course. The biggest one is androidx and/or Jetpack. At this time I believe you can take the certification using Java or Kotlin. Using Java is best for me at this time but as soon as I am done with the course I plan on learning Kotlin since it is the preferred way to do Android development.
